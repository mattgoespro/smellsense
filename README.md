# SmellSense - The Smell Training App

SmellSense is a mobile application used to aid the recovery of sense of taste and smell.

SmellSense was designed to provide the following functionality:

- Facilitate the process of smell training as an aid to recovery for those suffering the loss of their sense of smell (Anosmia) or an altered sense of smell (Parosmia).
- Guide the user through the smell training progress through encouragements and timing.
- Maintain a record/diary of your training progress over time.
- Provide you with resources to understand what has happened to your smell and how to regain it in a controlled but efficient manner.

## What is _Smell Training_?

Smell training is a little-known but scientifically proven method of quickly regaining one's sense of smell by utilizing a complex mechanism of the brain called 'Neuroplasticity', instead of waiting for long periods for your smell to naturally return to normal.

## Known Issues

- Starting a training session that starts before the day ends and ends after the next day begins will break training history.
  - Remediation:
    - Option 1: Use the date that the user commits the training session as the date of the training session.
    - Option 2: Prompt user to restart training session, saving their data, or cancel the session completely.
